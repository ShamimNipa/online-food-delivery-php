<br>
Governing Law
All matters relating to the Website, these Terms of Use, any goods or services provided by Company, and any dispute,
claim, disagreement, or other matter arising from or relating to any of the foregoing (in each case, including
non-contractual disputes or claims, a “Claim”), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws
of the State of Minnesota without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State
of Minnesota or any other jurisdiction).
<br>
Disputes
BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU ARE AGREEING THAT YOU AND COMPANY ARE EACH GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OR
TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AGAINST THE OTHER. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND COMPANY ARE EACH GIVING UP
THE RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICPATE IN A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER, WHETHER IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION.
<br>
You and Company agree to settle all Claims by binding individual arbitration between You and Company, and not in a court
of law. You acknowledge and agree that You and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate
as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Unless both You and Company
otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class,
collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding. However, You and Company each retain the right to bring an
individual action in small claims court. You and Company also each retain the right to seek injunctive or other
equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
misappropriation, or violation of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.
<br>
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the AAA’s
Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in
effect, except as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. As of the most recent Modified Date of these Terms of Use, the
AAA Rules were available at https://www.adr.org/Rules or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
<br>
You and Company agree that the arbitrator (“Arbitrator”), and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall
have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or
formation of this Dispute section of these Terms of Use, including any claim that all or any part of this Dispute
section is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability
issues, including issues relating to whether the Terms of Use are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to
arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.

Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in these Terms of Use, You and Company agree and acknowledge that
this Dispute section relates to interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”),
will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties that
the FAA and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and AAA Rules are
found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Dispute section or the enforcement thereof, then that issue shall
be resolved under the laws of the State of Minnesota.

A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as
specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration - Consumer Arbitration Rules at www.adr.org
or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879). The Arbitrator will be either (1) a retired judge or (2) an attorney
specifically licensed to practice law in the state where the arbitration occurs and will be selected by the parties from
the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an Arbitrator within seven (7)
days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the Arbitrator in accordance with the AAA
Rules.

Unless You and Company otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where You reside. If Your claim
does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents You and Company submit
to the Arbitrator, unless You request a hearing or the Arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If Your claim
exceeds $10,000, Your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the Arbitrator
will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited
nature of the arbitration. You understand and agree that these exchanges of information as well as certain other rights,
such as the discovery and appeal rights normally available during litigation in a court of law, will be different and
more limited in arbitration than they would be in a court of law.

The Arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award
may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to do so. The Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive
relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s
individual claim. An Arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on all parties. An Arbitrator’s decision and
judgment thereon shall have no precedential or collateral estoppel effect.

Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA
Rules. However, if Your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, and if You anticipate financial hardship in bringing
Your Claim as a result of such fees, You may submit a written request explaining your circumstances to Company by email
to service@fooddudesdelivery.com or by mail to 26 32nd Ave S, St. Cloud, MN 56301, and Company may in its sole
discretion elect to pay all such fees on your behalf, unless the Arbitrator finds that either the substance of Your
claim or the relief sought in Your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as
measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

If Company changes this Dispute section after the date You first agreed to the Terms of Use (or to any subsequent
changes to the Terms of Use), You may reject any such change by providing Company with written notice of such rejection
within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Modified” date above. This written
